# pwills.com

Source for [pwills.com][4], hosted on GitHub Pages. Functions as an online
resume/portfolio, as well as a place for me to rant & rave about technology and
math. 

To build the site locally, do

	git clone https://github.com/peterewills/peterewills.github.io.git
	cd peterewills.github.io
	bundle update # to make sure all ruby gems are up to date
	bundle exec jekyll serve
	
Then navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to view the page.

Site is built in jekyll on top of [Minimal Mistakes][1]. Uses images from
[Unsplash][2]. Drop me a line if you have questions, [peter@pwills.com][3].
