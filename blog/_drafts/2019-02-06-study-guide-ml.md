title: "Data Science Study Guide Part I: Machine Learning"

Data science interviews tend to focus on four main topics: computer science
(coding), statistics, machine learning, and databases (SQL). I've been building
an archive of learning materials that I go through whenever I'm preparing for an
interview, so I figured I would share it here. The plan is to go through each of
the four topics individually, and outline the material that one should be
familiar with before walking into a data science interview.

I'm not going to go into much depth. In most instances, I'll just touch on the
topics to know, rather than do much explanation. For example, if there's a
bullet point that says "Naive Bayes Classifier", you should ask yourself: do I
understand the basics of how that model works? Could I speak intelligently about
it if asked? Do I know when it is and is not applicable? This guide is more of a
skeleton of what you need to know - to flesh it out, you'll have to go to
secondary sources, such as textbooks, Wikipedia, and other online resources.

For no particular reason, we'll start with machine learning.

A good place to start is with a description of
