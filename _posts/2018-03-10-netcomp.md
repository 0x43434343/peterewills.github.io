title: "NetComp: Python Network Comparison"

As I worked on my research on network data analysis, it became clear that there
was a need for a Python library that implemented the analytical tools I was
interested in. The ubiquitous NetworkX package contains quite a few metrics, but
since it is such a popular package, it does not implement research algorithms
until they reach a high level of maturity. I decided to NetComp in order to
bridge this gap.
