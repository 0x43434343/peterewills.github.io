**Under Construction!**

I've selected the major projects I've done over the years which represent my
skills and interestes, and written up summaries here. The topics cover
mathematical physics to machine learning, and you'll find everything from a
Python library to research publications to fun side-projects included.

The discussion here is generally non-technical; for many of the projects, a
related publication can be found in [my resume][1]. If you're curious about
technical details I've glossed over, feel free to [contact me][2].
