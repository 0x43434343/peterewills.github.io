# Research

**Under Construction!**

My research over the years has spanned a variety of fields, including
statistics, nonlinear waves, and most recently analysis of graph data
(a.k.a. network data). I'll try to give the elevator-talk version of things
here, without getting too technical. For more details, look for links to the
relevant papers. For a list of my publications, see [my resume][1].
