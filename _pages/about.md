# About Me

**I do data. I have a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, and I love solving problems
  and learning new methods and technologies.**
  
I help organizations understand and leverage their quantitative
information. Call it what you will: data science, machine learning, or
statistics; the modern technological world lies at the intersection of
mathematics and computing, and that's where I like to play.

I have a bachelors in Physics from Reed College, where I did [my thesis][2] on
measurement of quantum entanglement in optical systems. After spending some time
pursuing other interests[^fnote2], I began working on my Ph.D. in Applied
Mathematics at University of Colorado. I'm currently finishing up my
dissertation, which covers a range of topics in statistics, data analytics, and
understanding noisy systems. For more details on all that, see
[Research](/research/).

I've worked with Stage 1 start-ups and well-established corporations, building
models, establishing codebases, and providing mathematical expertise to
developers. My mother tongue is Python, and I also speak R and Matlab. If you've
got a data problem you want to address, or just want to know what you can get
out of all this information you're gathering, just [drop me a line][1].

[^fnote2]: After graduating from Reed, I spent some time living at
	[Great Vow Zen Monastery][3], where we followed a daily schedule of work,
	eating, and meditation. I continue to practice Buddhism, and it continues to
	practice me.
